since the tallest candles are of height 4 and 2 there are  such candles.

Sample Output 0

2
Explanation 0

We have one candle of height 1, one candle of height 2, and two candles of height 3. Your niece only blows out the tallest candles,
meaning the candles where height = 3. Because there are 2 such candles, we print 2 on a new line.
